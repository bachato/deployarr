sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

## Install Deployrr v6

Install Deployrr (same command to update Deployrr):
```bash
sudo npx @simplehomelab/deployrr@latest
```

That is it. You can run Deployrr from anywhere using the command:
```bash
deployrr
```

## Version 5 Support

If your version 5 stopped working, it is probably because you are on a version older than v5.11.2, which is the latest and the last version of Deployrr v5. 

In order to have continued access to version 5 of Deployrr, please manually download v5.11.2 ([v5 branch](https://github.com/SimpleHomelab/Deployrr/tree/v5)) using the following commands:

```
wget https://github.com/SimpleHomelab/Deployrr/raw/refs/heads/v5/deployrr_v5.11.2.app
chmod +x deployrr_v5.11.2.app
./deployrr_v5.11.2.app
```

Use the `deployrr_v5.11.2-arm.app` if you are on ARM architecture.
